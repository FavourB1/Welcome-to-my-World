## Tip of the Iceberg
---
I am interested in the intersection of digital media, creative writing and how Artifical Intelligence is at the center of these connections. I love that my background in literature, journalism has helped me look forward to discovering a multi-dimensional approach to the study of technologyâ€™s role in modern storytelling.

Still fresh into research at UCF, I have started examining some digital tools and their impact on users, particularly focusing on emotional and physical responses to online content. 

My aim is to create and contribute to advancements in digital media, assessing the influence of digital media on user experience, and bridigng the gap between technology and human-centered digital experiences, through academic and industry collaborations.

### Outside the Borders of Research
Curiosity has not "killed my cat", it has made me a better writer, a better singer, songwriter and guitarist. Curiosity is what drives learning; we stop wondering, we stop knowing. So, you should find me around intellectual discussions often. And, time has no limits with me when music is involved - unless I fall asleep. I have enough jokes in my head that can keep me going throughout a day, hence, I am rarely bored. One quote that I hope will be pinned to my byline is: "If you are looking forward and upwards, you will never find out who is looking down on you."
