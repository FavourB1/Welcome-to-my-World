## Tip of the Iceberg
---
I am interested in the intersection of digital media, creative writing and how Artifical Intelligence is at the center of these connections. My background in literature and journalism has helped me look forward to discovering a multi-dimensional approach to the study of technology’s role in modern storytelling.

Still fresh into research at UCF, I have started examining some digital tools and their impact on users, particularly focusing on emotional and physical responses to online content. 

My aim is to create and contribute to advancements in digital media, assessing the influence of digital media on user experience, and bridigng the gap between technology and human-centered digital experiences, through academic and industry collaborations.

### Outside the Borders of Research...

Curiosity has not “killed my cat,” it has made me a better writer, a better singer, songwriter, and guitarist, a better everything. Curiosity is what drives learning; we stop wondering, we stop knowing.

I enjoy being around intellectual discussions often, listening or speaking. And time has no limits with me when music is involved; singing or listening to it - unless I fall asleep.

I have enough jokes, scripts, lyrics or adulting plans in my head that can keep me going throughout a day.

Most of the things I know about cars would be because my dad did not forget to tell me what the difference between the front wheel and back wheel drive is, the reasons for oil change that I should not miss and other experiences he remembers to narrate to me after his visits to his mechanic. So, I am cool when I converse with a mechanic, with lines in my mind that ‘I am not the typical girl that will be cheated, because I do know something about car parts - yes.’ 
My siblings think I should eat more and better, while my mom believes my decision to eat healthily is profitable. So, I am torn between eating a lot of fruits and vegetables, or eating a lot so I look my age in stature, on days when I care about food.

I am dedicating my portfolio to my family. They have made life, homely.

One quote that I hope will be on my byline is: “If you are looking forward and upward, you will never find out who is looking down on you.”
